A shuddering exorcism spins out of control and claims the life of a young girl. Months later, while working the night shift at the hospital morgue, Megan Reed receives a disfigured corpse. Alone and locked in the corridors of the cold basement, she starts to experience hair-raising visions, which lead her to suspect that the dead body delivered that night is possessed by a ruthless evil entity.
