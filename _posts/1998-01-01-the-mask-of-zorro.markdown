In 1821 Old California--after humiliating once more the evil Spanish governor, Don Rafael Montero--the mysterious black-caped masked avenger of the oppressed, Don Diego de la Vega, or Zorro, finds himself incarcerated. With his only daughter raised by Don Rafael as his own, the grizzled swordsman makes a daring escape nearly two decades later, and takes under his wing the unrefined outlaw, Alejandro Murietta, to teach him the ropes and, hopefully, become the next Zorro. Now, the stage seems set for a ferocious final confrontation, as the new young rapier-wielder prepares to thwart the despicable governor's sinister plans. Can Alejandro live up to legendary Zorro's name?
