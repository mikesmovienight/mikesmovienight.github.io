Because of the notoriety she gained from the Miss United States pageant, Gracie Hart's (Sandra Bullock's) life as an undercover F.B.I. Agent is over. In addition, Agent Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) broke off their relationship which she did not take well. Begrudgingly on the advice her boss, F.B.I. Assistant Director Harry McDonald (Ernie Hudson), Gracie decides to become the F.B.I.'s media relations officer. Ten months later with the assistance of style coach Joel Meyers (Diedrich Bader) and a best-selling book behind her about her experience, Gracie becomes a designer-clad media darling and the made-up face of the F.B.I. The new Gracie is the exact opposite of Agent Sam Fuller (Regina King), a woman who, like Gracie before her pageant experience, has deep seated anger issues. The two do not get along, but that doesn't stop McDonald from assigning Sam to be Gracie's bodyguard. The two are sent to Las Vegas, Nevada when Gracie's friend, reigning Miss United States Cheryl Frasier (Heather Burns), and the long-time Miss United States pageant host Stan Fields (William Shatner) were kidnapped there. At the F.B.I.'s Las Vegas field office, Assistant Director Walter Collins (Treat Williams) wants Gracie solely to be the media spokesperson on the case, but Gracie wants to be back in the field, especially when she uncovers some leads that Collins dismisses. Despite their antagonistic relationship, Gracie and Sam have to work together to follow these leads. Along with them are Joel and insecure F.B.I. Agent Jeff Foreman (Enrique Murciano), the foursome who, in addition to finding Cheryl and Stan, have to elude Collins' other Agents, Collins, who wants Gracie and Sam back on a plane to New York City, and who wants the glory of solving the case for himself.
