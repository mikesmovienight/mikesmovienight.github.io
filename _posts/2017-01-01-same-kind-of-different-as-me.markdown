Ron Hall (Greg Kinnear) lost track of what matters most in life. It took an affair, a confession, a dream and an unlikely friendship with a homeless man to help him remember. From the outside, Ron Hall's seemingly charmed life looked pretty perfect: He had a flourishing art business, a beautiful wife, Debbie (Renée Zellweger), two fine teen children, and an amazing fifteen thousand square foot house in Fort Worth, Texas. But appearances can be deceptive.
