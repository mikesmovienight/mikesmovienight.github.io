Poland June 1941, as German troops take over the Eastern side of the city of Przemysl from the Russians. To save their belongings from the Nazis, the Jewish family Diamant transfers them to their 17-year-old Catholic maid Fusia. In return Fusia provides them with food until the ghetto is dissolved, and then hides 13 people in her loft for over two years. However, as the front approaches and two German nurses take quarter in Fusias apartment everything seems to be in vain.
