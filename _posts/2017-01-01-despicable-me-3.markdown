After he is fired from the Anti-Villain League for failing to take down the latest bad guy to threaten humanity, Gru (Steve Carell) finds himself in the midst of a major identity crisis. But when a mysterious stranger shows up to inform Gru that he has a long-lost twin brother - a brother who desperately wishes to follow in his twin's despicable footsteps - one former supervillain will rediscover just how good it feels to be bad.
