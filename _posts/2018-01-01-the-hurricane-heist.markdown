In 1992 Alabama, Will and Breeze Rutledge are evacuating from the destructive Category 5 Hurricane Andrew with their dad. However, their truck gets stuck after avoiding a toppling tree in front of them and they are forced to take refuge in a nearby house. While trying to save the truck from blowing away, strong winds blow a water tank loose and it crushes their dad, killing him. In present day, another destructive hurricane named Tammy approaches the town in Alabama. Treasury agent Casey Corbyn is ordered by fellow employee Randy Moreno to summon Breeze, who now works as a handyman, and whose brother Will is a meteorologist, to fix the generator at a cash storage facility. While she is out of the facility, rogue Treasury agents, led by Connor Perkins, infiltrate the facility and hold employee Moreno hostage..
