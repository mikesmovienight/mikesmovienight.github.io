After the death of her mother, Sarah Goodall struggles to make sense of her life, her purpose and her faith. Having spent most of her adolescent years positioning herself to find a cure for her mother's illness, she battles with feelings of guilt and failure that send her spiraling downward. Her intensifying relationship with a mysterious bad boy only seems to add to the confusion. Once an honor student, Sarah begins failing her classes, jeopardizing her scholarship and her future. When an American transfer student arrives on the scene, he takes a vested interest in Sarah, helping her find what she's counted as lost.
