The George Gallup Institute reports that 70% of all Americans believe in Heaven and 53% believe in Hell. The Bible's view of the afterlife is embraced by more people living today than by any other generation in history. This film examines the histories of both places and how they came to be. Heaven is Real reveals the spiritual mysteries and physical characteristics of Heaven and Hell.
