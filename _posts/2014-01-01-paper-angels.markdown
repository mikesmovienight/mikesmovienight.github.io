Darryl Brandt fails as family father due to alcohol abuse rendering him somewhat mean and utterly lazy. Without proper plan or consulting the kids, wife Lynn sneaks out for good on Christmas. She takes a measly waitress job, model son must rebuild his life and still tries to be a substitute father for spoiled little sister Sara. Thomas get picked beyond newbie-hazing at in high-school when the cool kids find out his family is dead-poor, jocks top-dog Vic West even makes it a personal vendetta when AAs-'nerd' Thomas tries out for 'his' basketball team and is at least as good at that too. Kevin Morrell, who wrestles with a business in trouble and a problem twins pregnancy, seeks solace by returning to pastor and team coach Graham Cody's big brother program and becomes Thomas's mentor. At Christmas, things get complicated around the Salvation Army's Paper Angesl program to anonymously fulfill poor kids' wishes..
