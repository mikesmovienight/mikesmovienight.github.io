I"¿<p>In the year 2054 A.D. crime is virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. thanks to an elite law enforcing squad â€œPrecrimeâ€. They use three gifted humans (called â€œPre-Cogsâ€) with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the systemâ€™s flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesnâ€™t even know the victim. He decides to get to the mysteryâ€™s core by finding out the â€˜minority reportâ€™ which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that â€œmightâ€ tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.</p>
