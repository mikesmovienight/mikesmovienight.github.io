I"Ž<p>Caden Welles has the world at his disposal. With the resources of his wealthy father, heâ€™s living life as large as any 20-year-old could dream. But what happens when that dream becomes a nightmare halfway around the world? Traveling with his friends to Hyderabad, India on a whim, Cadenâ€™s expectations of a never-ending party crash hard. But not as hard as his conscience when he refuses to help a starving man and his little girl. Haunted by the images of Kiran and Annika, Caden attempts to right his wrong-only to discover Kiran has been forced to sell his own daughter. Cadenâ€™s eyes are now opened to a world few Americans know still exists: a thriving human-trafficking trade. Add the dehumanization of Kiran and hundreds of millions of other Dalits due to Indiaâ€™s caste system, and Caden could easily turn his back. Yet spurred by a true purpose, an unlikely new friendship, and the prayers of his mother and girlfriend back home, Caden chooses to help in Kiranâ€™s unlikely search to find his daughter. Starring Cody Longo, Walid Amini, Shari Rigby, and John Schneider, NOT TODAY challenges moviegoers with a purpose that goes beyond its gripping story. The movie was produced by Friends Church Yorba Linda, a congregation committed to educating the Dalits and ending human trafficking in India. NOT TODAY is a powerful reminder that change is possible if weâ€™re willing to open our eyes â€¦ today.</p>
