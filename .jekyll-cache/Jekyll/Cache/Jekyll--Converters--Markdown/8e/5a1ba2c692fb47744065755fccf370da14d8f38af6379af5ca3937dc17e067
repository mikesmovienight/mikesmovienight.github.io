I"ƒ<p>Based on the true story of the ill-fated 13th Apollo mission bound for the moon. Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert were scheduled to fly Apollo 14, but are moved up to 13. Itâ€™s 1970, and The US has already achieved their lunar landing goal, so thereâ€™s little interest in this â€œroutineâ€ flight.. until that is, things go very wrong, and prospects of a safe return fade.</p>
