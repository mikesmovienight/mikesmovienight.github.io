I"n<p>PREPARE TO ENTER A WORLD WHERE THERE’S ONLY ONE RULE: NEVER SNITCH. From award winning* Director, Steve Rahaman (Pain, To Be King), and starring Daniel O’Shea (Hamburger Hill, Boardwalk Empire) and Kevin Moccia (Pain), SNITCHES is a heart-pounding ride that leads us down into a world where murder and greed are a part of everyday life, and the code of the streets is the only law of the land…until the crime boss of Queens, Alphonse Trapani discovers that the one rule of the streets has been broken, there is a Snitch in his crew. Alphonse Trapani (Frank Merlino) sets a reward for anyone who can find the snitch who has been working with dirty cops and threatens to shut down all the crime families in New York. Not knowing who to trust, Alphonse sends his most loyal men, Vincent Abeli (Daniel O’Shea) and Salvatore Fini (Kevin Moccia) to find the snitch before it’s too late. As Alphonse Trapani (Frank Merlino)’s world begins to fall apart, he pushes the people he cares about most even further away, his son Sean (Erik Wegner), and most trusted employee, Sophia (Isa Feliu). Alone and desperate, Alphonse turns to Mikey (Kenneth Carrella) and his right hand man, Rocco (Anthony Bisciello) to help keep his empire from falling apart, while Vincent and Salvatore search every dark corner of the city for the snitch before suspicions turn old friends into enemies…</p>
