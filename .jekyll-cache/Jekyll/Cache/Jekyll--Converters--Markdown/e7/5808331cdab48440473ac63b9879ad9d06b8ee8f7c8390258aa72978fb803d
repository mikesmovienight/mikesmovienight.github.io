I"N<p>Just north of the Mexican border in Terlingua, Texas lives a lone cowboy in a house the size of a dorm room. He grows his own food, bathes with rainwater and washes his clothes with a bicycle. A more modern off-gridder in Nederland, Colorado built a mountaintop masterpiece using two shipping containers and heats this incredible home using the sun. And on the outskirts of Taos, New Mexico, a family of four lives off the grid with virtually no utility bills in an “Earthship” built from tires collected from the dump with dirt insulation and an indoor plant filtration system.</p>
