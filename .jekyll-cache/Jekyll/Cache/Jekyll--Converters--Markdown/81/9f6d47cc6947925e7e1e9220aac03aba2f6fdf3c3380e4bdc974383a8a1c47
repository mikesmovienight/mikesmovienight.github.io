I"þ<p>In April 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars, H.M.S. Surprise, a British frigate, is under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey. Aubrey and the Surpriseâ€™s current orders are to track and capture or destroy a French privateer named Acheron. The Acheron is currently in the Atlantic off South America headed toward the Pacific in order to extend Napoleonâ€™s reach of the wars. This task will be a difficult one as Aubrey quickly learns in an initial battle with the Acheron that it is a bigger and faster ship than the Surprise, which puts the Surprise at a disadvantage. Aubreyâ€™s single-mindedness in this seemingly impossible pursuit puts him at odds with the Surpriseâ€™s doctor and naturalist, Stephen Maturin, who is also Aubreyâ€™s most trusted advisor on board and closest friend. Facing other internal obstacles which have resulted in what they consider a string of bad luck, Aubrey ultimately uses Maturinâ€™s scientific exploits to figure out a way to achieve his and the shipâ€™s seemingly impossible goal.</p>
