But when a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime he canâ€™t seem to escape, and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the worldâ€™s stage, and to bring home the man who made them a family.</p>
