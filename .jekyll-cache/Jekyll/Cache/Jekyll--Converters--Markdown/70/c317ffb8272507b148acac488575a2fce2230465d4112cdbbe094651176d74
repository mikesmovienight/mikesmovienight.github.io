I"Â<p>Centuries ago, the evil Emperor Han was cursed by the sorceress Zi Yuan who transformed him and his army into mummies. In 1946, the explorer Rick Oâ€™Connell and his wife Evelyn Oâ€™Connell are invited by the British government to take a relic, the diamond â€œThe Eye of Shangri-Laâ€ to China. The ancient stone is capable of resurrecting the Emperor Han and of pointing the way to Shangri-La and the eternal pool of life. When the couple reaches China, they meet their son Alex Oâ€™Connell, who has discovered the tomb of Han, and Evelynâ€™s brother Jonathan Carnahan. The Oâ€™Connells are betrayed by their friend Prof. Roger Wilson, who is associated with General Yang. Yang wants to serve Emperor Han, so he resurrects the mummy and they head for Shangri-La. The guardian of Hanâ€™s tomb (and Ziâ€™s daughter) Lin tells them that the only ways to destroy Han are to prevent him from reaching Shangri-La or by stabbing his heart with a cursed dagger.</p>
