about-author: Hey, welcome to Mike's movie night! I started this event for international students at University of Illinois to enrich their experience in the United States, and it has grown and become a great place to have fun, make friends, and watch movies. My ultimate goal is to bring you some moments of happiness in this crazy, messed up world. Thank you for being part of the movie family!
